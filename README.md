# twoptowerdefense

is a game like tower defense, but instead of playing against your computer, you can play against your friends! Build your base and place turrets to defend it, then attack your opponent's base. Maneuver your player in first-person to avoid turrets and get to your opponent’s tower before they get to yours.
